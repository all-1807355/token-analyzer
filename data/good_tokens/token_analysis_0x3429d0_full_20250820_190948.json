To change this, you should override\\n * this function so it returns a different value.\\n *\\n * We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert\\n * instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless\\n * conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20\\n * applications.\\n *\\n * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.\\n * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just\\n * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit\\n * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.\\n *\\n * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}\\n * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting\\n * allowances.
