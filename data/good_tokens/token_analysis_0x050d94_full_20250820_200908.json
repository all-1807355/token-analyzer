Thousands of \"Something-Inu\" tokens have launched since then \r\nattempting to capitalize on both whatever the current \"trend\" is as well as those \r\nhoping to buy in early on the \"NEXT SHIBA INU\", thus destroying trust in the INU name \r\nand the promises that came along with it.\r\n\r\nToday, even Shiba Inu itself has strayed far away from the original vision its creator \r\nintended.\r\n\r\nFilling up the market with these \"Trend-Inu\" tokens has left many hopeful investors burned\r\nand rugged, and has fractured the Memecoin community as a whole. Nowadays, building the \r\n\"Next Shiba Inu\" feels like an impossible task, as there is seemingly no place for the \r\nlaymen to come together and build outside of trend-chasing dog coins with dev teams who \r\nalways let their communities down.\r\n\r\nUntil now.\r\n\r\nINU is a safe haven for all.\r\n\r\nA token with no team, no dev, no tax, no temporary meme trend name, no expectations past what\r\nYOU (the community) bring to the table.\r\n\r\nINU represents the lost memories of a time when community was truly all that was needed for\r\ngenerations of riches to be created.\r\n\r\nLiquidity has been burned upon creation, 50% of supply has been burned, there is no official\r\nsite, telegram, twitter, logo, or anything past the INU contract itself.\r\n\r\nIt is up to YOU, the individual, to bring glory and wealth back to the INU name.\r\n\r\nAll hail the Inu.\r\n\r\n*/\r\n\r\n// File: contracts\\open-zeppelin-contracts\\token\\ERC20\\IERC20.sol\r\n\r\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * @dev Interface of the ERC20 standard as defined in the EIP.
