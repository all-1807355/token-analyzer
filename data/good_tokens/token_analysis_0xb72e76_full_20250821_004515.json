The first is that a valid permit signature\r\n * expresses an allowance, and it should not be assumed to convey additional meaning. In particular, it should not be\r\n * considered as an intention to spend the allowance in any specific way. The second is that because permits have\r\n * built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun. A protocol that uses permits should\r\n * take this into consideration and allow a `permit` call to fail. Combining these two aspects, a pattern that may be\r\n * generally recommended is:\r\n *\r\n * ```solidity\r\n * function doThingWithPermit(..., uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {\r\n *     try token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}\r\n *     doThing(..., value);\r\n * }\r\n *\r\n * function doThing(..., uint256 value) public {\r\n *     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);\r\n *     ...\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * Observe that: 1) `msg.sender` is used as the owner, leaving no ambiguity as to the signer intent, and 2) the use of\r\n * `try/catch` allows the permit to fail and makes the code tolerant to frontrunning. (See also\r\n * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).\r\n *\r\n * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so\r\n * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.\r\n */\r\ninterface IERC20Permit {\r\n    /**\r\n     * @dev Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over ``owner``'s tokens,\r\n     * given ``owner``'s signed approval.\r\n     *\r\n     * IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction\r\n     * ordering also apply here.\r\n     *\r\n     * Emits an {Approval} event.\r\n     *\r\n     * Requirements:\r\n     *\r\n     * - `spender` cannot be the zero address.\r\n     * - `deadline` must be a timestamp in the future.\r\n     * - `v`, `r` and `s` must be a valid `secp256k1` signature from `owner`\r\n     * over the EIP712-formatted function arguments.\r\n     * - the signature must use ``owner``'s current nonce (see {nonces}).\r\n     *\r\n     * For more information on the signature format, see the\r\n     * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP\r\n     * section].\r\n     *\r\n     * CAUTION: See Security Considerations above.\r\n     */\r\n    function permit(\r\n        address owner,\r\n        address spender,\r\n        uint256 value,\r\n        uint256 deadline,\r\n        uint8 v,\r\n        bytes32 r,\r\n        bytes32 s\r\n    ) external;\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * @dev Returns the current nonce for `owner`.
