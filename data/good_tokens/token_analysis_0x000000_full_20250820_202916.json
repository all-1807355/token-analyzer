The first is that a valid permit signature\\n * expresses an allowance, and it should not be assumed to convey additional meaning.

The second is that because permits have\\n * built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun.

Combining these two aspects, a pattern that may be\\n * generally recommended is:\\n *\\n * ```solidity\\n * function doThingWithPermit(..., uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {\\n *     try token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}\\n *     doThing(..., value);\\n * }\\n *\\n * function doThing(..., uint256 value) public {\\n *     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);\\n *     ...\\n * }\\n * ```\\n *\\n * Observe that: 1) `msg.sender` is used as the owner, leaving no ambiguity as to the signer intent, and 2) the use of\\n * `try/catch` allows the permit to fail and makes the code tolerant to frontrunning. (See also\\n * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).\\n *\\n * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so\\n * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.\\n */\\ninterface IERC20Permit {\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over ``owner``'s tokens,\\n     * given ``owner``'s signed approval.\\n     *\\n     * IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction\\n     * ordering also apply here.\\n     *\\n     * Emits an {Approval} event.\\n     *\\n     * Requirements:\\n     *\\n     * - `spender` cannot be the zero address.\\n     * - `deadline` must be a timestamp in the future.\\n     * - `v`, `r` and `s` must be a valid `secp256k1` signature from `owner`\\n     * over the EIP712-formatted function arguments.\\n     * - the signature must use ``owner``'s current nonce (see {nonces}).\\n     *\\n     * For more information on the signature format, see the\\n     * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP\\n     * section].\\n     *\\n     * CAUTION: See Security Considerations above.\\n     */\\n    function permit(\\n        address owner,\\n        address spender,\\n        uint256 value,\\n        uint256 deadline,\\n        uint8 v,\\n        bytes32 r,\\n        bytes32 s\\n    ) external;\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Returns the current nonce for `owner`.
