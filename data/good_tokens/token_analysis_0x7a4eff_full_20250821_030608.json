This pattern implies two\\n * things that go hand in hand:\\n *\\n * 1. If any account other than the admin calls the proxy, the call will be forwarded to the implementation, even if\\n * that call matches the {ITransparentUpgradeableProxy-upgradeToAndCall} function exposed by the proxy itself.\\n * 2. If the admin calls the proxy, it can call the `upgradeToAndCall` function but any other call won't be forwarded to\\n * the implementation. If the admin tries to call a function on the implementation it will fail with an error indicating\\n * the proxy admin cannot fallback to the target implementation.\\n *\\n * These properties mean that the admin account can only be used for upgrading the proxy, so it's best if it's a\\n * dedicated account that is not used for anything else. This will avoid headaches due to sudden errors when trying to\\n * call a function from the proxy implementation. For this reason, the proxy deploys an instance of {ProxyAdmin} and\\n * allows upgrades only if they come through it. You should think of the `ProxyAdmin` instance as the administrative\\n * interface of the proxy, including the ability to change who can trigger upgrades by transferring ownership.\\n *\\n * NOTE: The real interface of this proxy is that defined in `ITransparentUpgradeableProxy`. This contract does not\\n * inherit from that interface, and instead `upgradeToAndCall` is implicitly implemented using a custom dispatch\\n * mechanism in `_fallback`. Consequently, the compiler will not produce an ABI for this contract. This is necessary to\\n * fully implement transparency without decoding reverts caused by selector clashes between the proxy and the\\n * implementation.\\n *\\n * NOTE: This proxy does not inherit from {Context} deliberately. The {ProxyAdmin} of this contract won't send a\\n * meta-transaction in any way, and any other meta-transaction setup should be made in the implementation contract.\\n *\\n * IMPORTANT: This contract avoids unnecessary storage reads by setting the admin only during construction as an\\n * immutable variable, preventing any changes thereafter. However, the admin slot defined in ERC-1967 can still be\\n * overwritten by the implementation logic pointed to by this proxy. In such cases, the contract may end up in an\\n * undesirable state where the admin slot is different from the actual admin.\\n *\\n * WARNING: It is not recommended to extend this contract to add additional external functions. If you do so, the\\n * compiler will not check that there are no selector conflicts, due to the note above. A selector clash between any new\\n * function and the functions declared in {ITransparentUpgradeableProxy} will be resolved in favor of the new one. This\\n * could render the `upgradeToAndCall` function inaccessible, preventing upgradeability and compromising transparency.\\n */\\ncontract TransparentUpgradeableProxy is ERC1967Proxy {\\n    // An immutable address for the admin to avoid unnecessary SLOADs before each call\\n    // at the expense of removing the ability to change the admin once it's set.\\n    // This is acceptable if the admin is always a ProxyAdmin instance or similar contract\\n    // with its own ability to transfer the permissions to another account.\\n    address private immutable _admin;\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev The proxy caller is the current admin, and can't fallback to the proxy target.\\n     */\\n    error ProxyDeniedAdminAccess();\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Initializes an upgradeable proxy managed by an instance of a {ProxyAdmin} with an `initialOwner`,\\n     * backed by the implementation at `_logic`, and optionally initialized with `_data` as explained in\\n     * {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\\n     */\\n    constructor(address _logic, address initialOwner, bytes memory _data) payable ERC1967Proxy(_logic, _data) {\\n        _admin = address(new ProxyAdmin(initialOwner));\\n        // Set the storage value and emit an event for ERC-1967 compatibility\\n        ERC1967Utils.changeAdmin(_proxyAdmin());\\n    }\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Returns the admin of this proxy.\\n     */\\n    function _proxyAdmin() internal virtual returns (address) {\\n        return _admin;\\n    }\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev If caller is the admin process the call internally, otherwise transparently fallback to the proxy behavior.\\n     */\\n    function _fallback() internal virtual override {\\n        if (msg.sender == _proxyAdmin()) {\\n            if (msg.sig != ITransparentUpgradeableProxy.upgradeToAndCall.selector) {\\n                revert ProxyDeniedAdminAccess();\\n            } else {\\n                _dispatchUpgradeToAndCall();\\n            }\\n        } else {\\n            super._fallback();\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Upgrade the implementation of the proxy.
