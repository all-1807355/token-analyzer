This pattern implies two\\n * things that go hand in hand:\\n *\\n * 1. If any account other than the admin calls the proxy, the call will be forwarded to the implementation, even if\\n * that call matches one of the admin functions exposed by the proxy itself.\\n * 2. If the admin calls the proxy, it can access the admin functions, but its calls will never be forwarded to the\\n * implementation. If the admin tries to call a function on the implementation it will fail with an error that says\\n * \\\"admin cannot fallback to proxy target\\\".\\n *\\n * These properties mean that the admin account can only be used for admin actions like upgrading the proxy or changing\\n * the admin, so it's best if it's a dedicated account that is not used for anything else. This will avoid headaches due\\n * to sudden errors when trying to call a function from the proxy implementation.\\n *\\n * Our recommendation is for the dedicated account to be an instance of the {ProxyAdmin} contract. If set up this way,\\n * you should think of the `ProxyAdmin` instance as the real administrative interface of your proxy.\\n *\\n * NOTE: The real interface of this proxy is that defined in `ITransparentUpgradeableProxy`. This contract does not\\n * inherit from that interface, and instead the admin functions are implicitly implemented using a custom dispatch\\n * mechanism in `_fallback`. Consequently, the compiler will not produce an ABI for this contract. This is necessary to\\n * fully implement transparency without decoding reverts caused by selector clashes between the proxy and the\\n * implementation.\\n *\\n * WARNING: It is not recommended to extend this contract to add additional external functions. If you do so, the compiler\\n * will not check that there are no selector conflicts, due to the note above. A selector clash between any new function\\n * and the functions declared in {ITransparentUpgradeableProxy} will be resolved in favor of the new one. This could\\n * render the admin operations inaccessible, which could prevent upgradeability. Transparency may also be compromised.\\n */\\ncontract TransparentUpgradeableProxy is ERC1967Proxy {\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Initializes an upgradeable proxy managed by `_admin`, backed by the implementation at `_logic`, and\\n     * optionally initialized with `_data` as explained in {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\\n     */\\n    constructor(address _logic, address admin_, bytes memory _data) payable ERC1967Proxy(_logic, _data) {\\n        _changeAdmin(admin_);\\n    }\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Modifier used internally that will delegate the call to the implementation unless the sender is the admin.\\n     *\\n     * CAUTION: This modifier is deprecated, as it could cause issues if the modified function has arguments, and the\\n     * implementation provides a function with the same selector.\\n     */\\n    modifier ifAdmin() {\\n        if (msg.sender == _getAdmin()) {\\n            _;\\n        } else {\\n            _fallback();\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev If caller is the admin process the call internally, otherwise transparently fallback to the proxy behavior\\n     */\\n    function _fallback() internal virtual override {\\n        if (msg.sender == _getAdmin()) {\\n            bytes memory ret;\\n            bytes4 selector = msg.sig;\\n            if (selector == ITransparentUpgradeableProxy.upgradeTo.selector) {\\n                ret = _dispatchUpgradeTo();\\n            } else if (selector == ITransparentUpgradeableProxy.upgradeToAndCall.selector) {\\n                ret = _dispatchUpgradeToAndCall();\\n            } else if (selector == ITransparentUpgradeableProxy.changeAdmin.selector) {\\n                ret = _dispatchChangeAdmin();\\n            } else if (selector == ITransparentUpgradeableProxy.admin.selector) {\\n                ret = _dispatchAdmin();\\n            } else if (selector == ITransparentUpgradeableProxy.implementation.selector) {\\n                ret = _dispatchImplementation();\\n            } else {\\n                revert(\\\"TransparentUpgradeableProxy: admin cannot fallback to proxy target\\\");\\n            }\\n            assembly {\\n                return(add(ret, 0x20), mload(ret))\\n            }\\n        } else {\\n            super._fallback();\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Returns the current admin.\\n     *\\n     * TIP: To get this value clients can read directly from the storage slot shown below (specified by EIP1967) using the\\n     * https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API#eth_getstorageat[`eth_getStorageAt`] RPC call.\\n     * `0xb53127684a568b3173ae13b9f8a6016e243e63b6e8ee1178d6a717850b5d6103`\\n     */\\n    function _dispatchAdmin() private returns (bytes memory) {\\n        _requireZeroValue();\\n\\n        address admin = _getAdmin();\\n        return abi.encode(admin);\\n    }\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Returns the current implementation.\\n     *\\n     * TIP: To get this value clients can read directly from the storage slot shown below (specified by EIP1967) using the\\n     * https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API#eth_getstorageat[`eth_getStorageAt`] RPC call.\\n     * `0x360894a13ba1a3210667c828492db98dca3e2076cc3735a920a3ca505d382bbc`\\n     */\\n    function _dispatchImplementation() private returns (bytes memory) {\\n        _requireZeroValue();\\n\\n        address implementation = _implementation();\\n        return abi.encode(implementation);\\n    }\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Changes the admin of the proxy.\\n     *\\n     * Emits an {AdminChanged} event.\\n     */\\n    function _dispatchChangeAdmin() private returns (bytes memory) {\\n        _requireZeroValue();\\n\\n        address newAdmin = abi.decode(msg.data[4:], (address));\\n        _changeAdmin(newAdmin);\\n\\n        return \\\"\\\";\\n    }\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Upgrade the implementation of the proxy.\\n     */\\n    function _dispatchUpgradeTo() private returns (bytes memory) {\\n        _requireZeroValue();\\n\\n        address newImplementation = abi.decode(msg.data[4:], (address));\\n        _upgradeToAndCall(newImplementation, bytes(\\\"\\\"), false);\\n\\n        return \\\"\\\";\\n    }\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Upgrade the implementation of the proxy, and then call a function from the new implementation as specified\\n     * by `data`, which should be an encoded function call.
