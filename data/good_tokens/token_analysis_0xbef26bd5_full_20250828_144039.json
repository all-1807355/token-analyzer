This pattern implies two\\n * things that go hand in hand:\\n *\\n * 1. If any account other than the admin calls the proxy, the call will be forwarded to the implementation, even if\\n * that call matches one of the admin functions exposed by the proxy itself.\\n * 2. If the admin calls the proxy, it can access the admin functions, but its calls will never be forwarded to the\\n * implementation. If the admin tries to call a function on the implementation it will fail with an error that says\\n * \\\"admin cannot fallback to proxy target\\\".\\n *\\n * These properties mean that the admin account can only be used for admin actions like upgrading the proxy or changing\\n * the admin, so it's best if it's a dedicated account that is not used for anything else. This will avoid headaches due\\n * to sudden errors when trying to call a function from the proxy implementation.\\n *\\n * Our recommendation is for the dedicated account to be an instance of the {ProxyAdmin} contract. If set up this way,\\n * you should think of the `ProxyAdmin` instance as the real administrative interface of your proxy.\\n *\\n * NOTE: The real interface of this proxy is that defined in `ITransparentUpgradeableProxy`. This contract does not\\n * inherit from that interface, and instead the admin functions are implicitly implemented using a custom dispatch\\n * mechanism in `_fallback`. Consequently, the compiler will not produce an ABI for this contract. This is necessary to\\n * fully implement transparency without decoding reverts caused by selector clashes between the proxy and the\\n * implementation.\\n *\\n * WARNING: It is not recommended to extend this contract to add additional external functions. If you do so, the compiler\\n * will not check that there are no selector conflicts, due to the note above. A selector clash between any new function\\n * and the functions declared in {ITransparentUpgradeableProxy} will be resolved in favor of the new one.
