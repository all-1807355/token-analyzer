This means\\n * that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using `_mint`.\\n * For a generic mechanism see `ERC20Mintable`.\\n *\\n * *For a detailed writeup see our guide [How to implement supply\\n * mechanisms](https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226).*\\n *\\n * We have followed general OpenZeppelin guidelines: functions revert instead\\n * of returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional\\n * and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications.\\n *\\n * Additionally, an `Approval` event is emitted on calls to `transferFrom`.\\n * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just\\n * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit\\n * these events, as it isn\\u0027t required by the specification.\\n *\\n * Finally, the non-standard `decreaseAllowance` and `increaseAllowance`\\n * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting\\n * allowances.
