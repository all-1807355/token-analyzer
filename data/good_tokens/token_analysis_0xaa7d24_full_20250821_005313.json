This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role\\n * members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some\\n * applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see\\n * {AccessControlEnumerable}.\\n *\\n * Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed\\n * in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by\\n * using `public constant` hash digests:\\n *\\n * ```solidity\\n * bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\\\"MY_ROLE\\\");\\n * ```\\n *\\n * Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a\\n * function call, use {hasRole}:\\n *\\n * ```solidity\\n * function foo() public {\\n *     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));\\n *     ...\\n * }\\n * ```\\n *\\n * Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and\\n * {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only\\n * accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.\\n *\\n * By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means\\n * that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other\\n * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using\\n * {_setRoleAdmin}.\\n *\\n * WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to\\n * grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure\\n * accounts that have been granted it. We recommend using {AccessControlDefaultAdminRules}\\n * to enforce additional security measures for this role.\\n */\\nabstract contract AccessControl is Context, IAccessControl, ERC165 {\\n    struct RoleData {\\n        mapping(address account => bool) hasRole;\\n        bytes32 adminRole;\\n    }\\n\\n    mapping(bytes32 role => RoleData) private _roles;\\n\\n    bytes32 public constant DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE = 0x00;\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Modifier that checks that an account has a specific role.
