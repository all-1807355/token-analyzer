This behavior is nonetheless conventional\r\n * and does not conflict with the expectations of BEP20 applications.\r\n *\r\n * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.\r\n * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just\r\n * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit\r\n * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.\r\n *\r\n * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}\r\n * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting\r\n * allowances.
