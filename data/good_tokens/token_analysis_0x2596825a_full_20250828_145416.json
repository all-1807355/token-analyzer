When a snapshot is created, the balances and\\n * total supply at the time are recorded for later access.\\n *\\n * This can be used to safely create mechanisms based on token balances such as trustless dividends or weighted voting.\\n * In naive implementations it's possible to perform a \\\"double spend\\\" attack by reusing the same balance from different\\n * accounts. By using snapshots to calculate dividends or voting power, those attacks no longer apply. It can also be\\n * used to create an efficient ERC20 forking mechanism.\\n *\\n * Snapshots are created by the internal {_snapshot} function, which will emit the {Snapshot} event and return a\\n * snapshot id. To get the total supply at the time of a snapshot, call the function {totalSupplyAt} with the snapshot\\n * id. To get the balance of an account at the time of a snapshot, call the {balanceOfAt} function with the snapshot id\\n * and the account address.\\n *\\n * NOTE: Snapshot policy can be customized by overriding the {_getCurrentSnapshotId} method. For example, having it\\n * return `block.number` will trigger the creation of snapshot at the begining of each new block. When overridding this\\n * function, be careful about the monotonicity of its result. Non-monotonic snapshot ids will break the contract.\\n *\\n * Implementing snapshots for every block using this method will incur significant gas costs. For a gas-efficient\\n * alternative consider {ERC20Votes}.\\n *\\n * ==== Gas Costs\\n *\\n * Snapshots are efficient. Snapshot creation is _O(1)_. Retrieval of balances or total supply from a snapshot is _O(log\\n * n)_ in the number of snapshots that have been created, although _n_ for a specific account will generally be much\\n * smaller since identical balances in subsequent snapshots are stored as a single entry.\\n *\\n * There is a constant overhead for normal ERC20 transfers due to the additional snapshot bookkeeping. This overhead is\\n * only significant for the first transfer that immediately follows a snapshot for a particular account. Subsequent\\n * transfers will have normal cost until the next snapshot, and so on.\\n */\\n\\nabstract contract ERC20Snapshot is ERC20 {\\n    // Inspired by Jordi Baylina's MiniMeToken to record historical balances:\\n    // https://github.com/Giveth/minimd/blob/ea04d950eea153a04c51fa510b068b9dded390cb/contracts/MiniMeToken.sol\\n\\n    using Arrays for uint256[];\\n    using Counters for Counters.Counter;\\n\\n    // Snapshotted values have arrays of ids and the value corresponding to that id.
