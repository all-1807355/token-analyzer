If you want to create a telegram I suggest to name it to @CHUBBYINUBSC\r\n   Important: The early you create a group that shares the token, the more gain you got.\r\n   \r\n   It's a community token, every holder should promote it, or create a group for it, \r\n   if you want to pump your investment, you need to do some effort.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   Great features:\r\n   5% fee auto add to the liquidity pool to locked forever when selling\r\n   2% fee auto distribute to all holders\r\n   90% burn to the black hole, with such big black hole and 5% fee, the strong holder will get a valuable reward\r\n\r\n   I will burn liquidity LPs to burn addresses to lock the pool forever.\r\n   I will renounce the ownership to burn addresses to transfer #CHUBBYINU to the community, make sure it's 100% safe.\r\n\r\n   I will add .2 BNB and all the left 10% total supply to the pool\r\n   Can you make #CHUBBYINU 10000X? \r\n\r\n   1,000,000,000,000,000 total supply\r\n   5,000,000,000,000 tokens limitation for trade, which is 0.5% of the total supply\r\n   \r\n   5% fee for liquidity will go to an address that the contract creates, \r\n   and the contract will sell it and add to liquidity automatically, \r\n   it's the best part of the #CHUBBYINU idea, increasing the liquidity pool automatically, \r\n   help the pool grow from the small init pool.\r\n   \r\n */\r\npragma solidity ^0.6.12;\r\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: Unlicensed\r\n\r\nabstract contract Context {\r\n    function _msgSender() internal view virtual returns (address payable) {\r\n        return msg.sender;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function _msgData() internal view virtual returns (bytes memory) {\r\n        this; // silence state mutability warning without generating bytecode - see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2691\r\n        return msg.data;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\ninterface IUniswapV2Factory {\r\n    event PairCreated(address indexed token0, address indexed token1, address pair, uint);\r\n\r\n    function feeTo() external view returns (address);\r\n    function feeToSetter() external view returns (address);\r\n\r\n    function getPair(address tokenA, address tokenB) external view returns (address pair);\r\n    function allPairs(uint) external view returns (address pair);\r\n    function allPairsLength() external view returns (uint);\r\n\r\n    function createPair(address tokenA, address tokenB) external returns (address pair);\r\n\r\n    function setFeeTo(address) external;\r\n    function setFeeToSetter(address) external;\r\n}\r\ninterface IERC20 {\r\n\r\n    function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256);\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * @dev Returns the amount of tokens owned by `account`.\r\n     */\r\n    function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256);\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * @dev Moves `amount` tokens from the caller's account to `recipient`.\r\n     *\r\n     * Returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded.\r\n     *\r\n     * Emits a {Transfer} event.\r\n     */\r\n    function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * @dev Returns the remaining number of tokens that `spender` will be\r\n     * allowed to spend on behalf of `owner` through {transferFrom}.
