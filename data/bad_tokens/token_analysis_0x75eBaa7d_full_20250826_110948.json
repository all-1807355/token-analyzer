Tired of rug pulls. \r\n    \r\n    Tired of the same old shitty posts on Reddit.\r\n    \r\n    So we have created a coin that is guaranteed to be safe, you will not be rug pulled here. \r\n    \r\n    This coin has the standard tokenomics you expect in a modern day smart contract.\r\n    \r\n    No fancy language about frictionless yields here. Although it does roll off the tongue.\r\n    \r\n    Join us at our telegram @JamesWebbBsc\r\n    \r\n    Website - https://jameswebb0.yolasite.com/\r\n    \r\n    The LP will be burned\r\n   \r\n    Ownership of the contract will be renounced to a burn address to transfer JamesWebbCoin over to the community to make sure it's 100% safe.\r\n  \r\n    5% fee will automatically be added to the liquidity pool\r\n    \r\n    2% fee will be automativally distributed to all holders\r\n    \r\n    1,000,000,000,000,000 - 50% will be immediately burned\r\n    \r\n    Max transaction amount of 5000000000000 (1%)\r\n\r\n */\r\n\r\npragma solidity ^0.6.12;\r\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: Unlicensed\r\n\r\nabstract contract Context {\r\n    function _msgSender() internal view virtual returns (address payable) {\r\n        return msg.sender;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function _msgData() internal view virtual returns (bytes memory) {\r\n        this; // silence state mutability warning without generating bytecode - see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2691\r\n        return msg.data;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\ninterface IUniswapV2Factory {\r\n    event PairCreated(address indexed token0, address indexed token1, address pair, uint);\r\n\r\n    function feeTo() external view returns (address);\r\n    function feeToSetter() external view returns (address);\r\n\r\n    function getPair(address tokenA, address tokenB) external view returns (address pair);\r\n    function allPairs(uint) external view returns (address pair);\r\n    function allPairsLength() external view returns (uint);\r\n\r\n    function createPair(address tokenA, address tokenB) external returns (address pair);\r\n\r\n    function setFeeTo(address) external;\r\n    function setFeeToSetter(address) external;\r\n}\r\ninterface IERC20 {\r\n\r\n    function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256);\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * @dev Returns the amount of tokens owned by `account`.\r\n     */\r\n    function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256);\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * @dev Moves `amount` tokens from the caller's account to `recipient`.\r\n     *\r\n     * Returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded.\r\n     *\r\n     * Emits a {Transfer} event.\r\n     */\r\n    function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * @dev Returns the remaining number of tokens that `spender` will be\r\n     * allowed to spend on behalf of `owner` through {transferFrom}.
